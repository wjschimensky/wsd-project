<p align="center"  style=" color:#FFF">The early history of martial arts is difficult to reconstruct. Inherent patterns of human aggression which inspire practice of mock combat<br />
(in particular wrestling) and optimization of serious close combat as cultural universals are doubtlessly inherited from the pre-human stage, and were made<br />
into an &quot;art&quot; from the 
earliest emergence of that concept. Indeed, many universals of martial art are fixed by the specifics of human physiology and not dependent on <br />
a specific
tradition or era..  Early history 
detail of the wrestling fresco in tomb 15 at Beni Hasan.The earliest evidence for specifics of martial arts as practiced in the past comes from depictions <br />
of fights, 
both in figurative art and in early literature, besides analysis of archaeological evidence, especially of weaponry. Wrestling is a human universal, and is also observed in other great apes, especially in juveniles.<br />
The spear has been in use since the Lower Paleolithic and retained its central importance well into the 2nd millennium AD. The bow appears in the Upper Paleolithic and is likewise only gradually replaced by the crossbow, and eventually firearms, in the Common Era. True bladed weapons appear in the Neolithic with the stone axe, and diversify in shape in the course of the Bronze Age (khopesh/kopis, sword, dagger) One very early example is the epiction of wrestling techniques in a tomb of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt at Beni Hasan (c. 2000 BC). </p>
